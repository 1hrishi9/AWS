### TCP vs UDP for Interview Purpose

TCP and UDP are two different transport layer protocols that are used to transmit data over a network. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, while UDP is a connectionless protocol.

**Connection-Oriented**

A connection-oriented protocol establishes a connection between the sender and receiver before sending any data. This connection is used to ensure that all data is delivered in the correct order and that no data is lost.

**Connectionless**

A connectionless protocol does not establish a connection between the sender and receiver before sending any data. This makes UDP faster and more efficient than TCP, but it also makes it less reliable.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between TCP and UDP:

| Feature | TCP | UDP |
|---|---|---|
| Connection-oriented | Yes | No |
| Reliable | Yes | No |
| Ordered delivery | Yes | No |
| Congestion control | Yes | No |
| Flow control | Yes | No |
| Overhead | High | Low |
| Speed | Slow | Fast |

**Use Cases**

TCP is typically used for applications where reliability and ordered delivery are important, such as file transfers, email, and web browsing. UDP is typically used for applications where speed and low latency are more important than reliability, such as online gaming, VoIP, and streaming video.

**Interview Questions**

Here are some interview questions that you may be asked about TCP and UDP:

* What are the key differences between TCP and UDP?
* When would you use TCP?
* When would you use UDP?
* What are the advantages and disadvantages of TCP?
* What are the advantages and disadvantages of UDP?

**Example Answers**

* **Key differences between TCP and UDP:** TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, while UDP is a connectionless protocol. TCP is reliable and ordered delivery, while UDP is unreliable and unordered delivery. TCP has high overhead, while UDP has low overhead. TCP is slow, while UDP is fast.
* **When to use TCP:** When reliability and ordered delivery are important, such as file transfers, email, and web browsing.
* **When to use UDP:** When speed and low latency are more important than reliability, such as online gaming, VoIP, and streaming video.
* **Advantages of TCP:** Reliability, ordered delivery, congestion control, and flow control.
* **Disadvantages of TCP:** High overhead and slow speed.
* **Advantages of UDP:** Low overhead and fast speed.
* **Disadvantages of UDP:** Unreliable and unordered delivery.
