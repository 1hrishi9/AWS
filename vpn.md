1. What is Site to Site VPN Connection?
By defaut, instances that you launch into an Amazon VPC cant communicate with your own (remote) network,
You can enable access to your remote network from your VPC by crating an AWS Ste-Site VPN,(Sito Ste VPN) connection, and configuring routing o pass traffic through the connection.

 

 

Example:
1. AWS Datacenter (VPC) to Ofc on premises Dataceter
2. One AWS Datacenter (VPC) to another AwS Datacenter (VPC)

3. Customer gateway: An AWS resource which provides information to AWS about your customer
gateway device

4. Customer gateway device: A physical devices or software application on your side of the Site-to-Ste VPN connecton.

6. Virtual private gateway: virtual private gateway is the VPN endpoint on the Amazon side of
yout St-o-Ste VPN connoction ta can be atached oa single VEC.

7. Transit gateway: A transit hub that can be used te interconnect multiple VPCs and on-premises
